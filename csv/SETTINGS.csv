The Access Link is valid for the number of days specified below.</span></p> <p>Access Link Security<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is important to recognize the Access Link it is not as secure as a traditional username and password, because anybody who obtains an individual's Access Link can log in as that individual. For this reason, we recommend choosing a short validity for the Access Link.</span></p> <p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""> The Hub designers (the Harmonist team and IeDEA consortium) felt this was a fair tradeoff because the Access Link greatly improved consortium members' access to the Hub as they did not need to remember new usernames and passwords. They also determined the operational information of the consortium, such as concept sheets, draft manuscripts, deadlines, or votes, was not highly sensitive.</span></p> <p>Sensitive Information<br /><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Sensitive information, such as research datasets and other private files, should not be stored on the general part of the Hub.
